# Ask user for name
# Create output text
# Print output to screen

# Search up Python docs
# Go to Python Standard Library
# Look for built in functions, read the documentation!
# This is a lot different from Java where you need scanner

s = input('-->') # If I input 'Coding is super fun'...
print(s)         # Then, 'Coding is super fun' is printed since it was saved as 's'. 

name = input("What is your name?:")
print(name)

# Ask user for age
age = input("What is your age?:")
print(age)

# Ask user for city
city = input("What is your city?:")
print(city)

# Ask user what they enjoy
enjoy = input("What do you enjoy?:")
print(enjoy)

# NOTE: Say you said '23' for the age question
# when you do type() you'll find that it was saved as a string.
