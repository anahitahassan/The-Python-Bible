<h2>Main Sections: </h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Variables </li> 
    <li>Numbers </li> 
    <li>Text (manipulating text) </li> 
    <li>Logic </li> 
    <li>Data Structures (dealing with lots of data) </li> 
    <li>Loops </li> 
    <li>Functions (tic tac toe game) </li> 
    <li>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) (classes, objects, etc) </li> 
  </ol>

<h2>Installing Python on Windows </h2>
  <li> Download most updated version of Python from the python website. </li> 
  <li> When you launch the installer, you'll see a window pop up. </li> 
  <li> Click the checkbox at the bottom that says add Py 3.9.6 to path. </li> 
  <li> Then click customize installation button <l/i> 
  <li> Don't mess with the default options that are already checked </li> 
  <li> Click next, then check the button that says install python for all users. </li> 
  <li> (The reason we do this is because it makes the install location for python much easier to deal with later.) </li> 
  <li> The install path shown in the box changes to something nicer. </li> 
  <li> Install will begin </li> 
  <li> Open up command prompt (go to menu and type cmd) </li> 
  <li> In all lowercase, write "python" and enter. </li>   
  <li> Some text should show up, meaning you have successfully installed and set up python on your windows machine. </li>   

<h2>IDLE: Python Interactive Developer Environment (IDE)</h2>
  <li> The program we use to write Python. </li>
  <li> IDLE is Python's own IDE (a useful text editor that makes it easier to program in a programming language). </li>
  <li> Used to run python commands and write python scripts. </li>
  <li> In search bar, search up 'idle'. You should see a window pop up - that box is known as the python shell. </li>
  <li> Whatever you type in there will be interpreted by python as a command. </li>
  <li> Go to the toolbar at the top. </li>
  <li> You can create new files, save files, etc. </li>
  <li> These files are python scripts. </li>
  <li> Under the 'Help' tab there is an option that says 'Python Docs', it's Documentation. </li>
  <li> You can enter commands like "1+1" or "40%5" and it will return the answer. </li>
  <li> To make our code reusable we use Python scripts - files that store commands. </li>
  <li> To make a script: go to toolbar -> New File -> go save it under name.py in your directory.  </li>
  <li> Toolbar -> Run -> Run Module. It runs our script. Remember to use print() function in order to print something. </li>
  <li> So it seems in order to open those scripts I have to go to search bar -> search up 'idle' -> have that window open -> then from the toolbar I open the script. </li>

<h2>Programming Tips </h2>
  <li> Ask great questions. Will help you save time and headache. </li>
  <li> Take advantage of the community of students. Look through the forums, Q&As. </li>
  <li> Take a look at the checklist. </li>
  <li> Search for questions, and you can ask questions. </li>
  <li> Have a great question title. Start with [Help]. When the question is answered, replace with [Solved]. </li>
  <li> For example: "Answer not being shown on screen when running python Script". </li>
  <li> Now this is very vauge, so in the description write: </li>
    <ol>
      <li> Observed Behavior
      <li> Expected Behavior
      <li> Link to Code (use gist.github.com)
      <li> Where I think the problem is
      <li> List of 3 things that I have done to try to solve the problem
      <li> Errors messages and warnings
      <li> Version of Python used
      <li> Screenshots where necessary 
    </ol>
  <li> Hopefully you were able to solve the problem while doing this list! </li>
